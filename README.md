# restaurand

Let's go out have lunch! Well, I am sure that you know plenty of good and fancy restaurants, but can you name 5 of the latests ones that you've come to? I can't, that is one of the reasons of creating *restaurand*.

<b>restaurand</b> is a simple application where you can add restaurants and then, ask for one suggestions. The restaurants suggested are from your collection and shown ussing some weighted randomness: the ones that you haven't seen in a while have more probability to appear than the others.

But there is a more important reason for the existance of restaurand: <b>learning</b>. This application is my test field where I can apply everything that I learn developing Android. So yes, some things are not necessary, there are best ways to do others, but keep in mind that what I want to do with the app is to use different approaches and try the latests trends of Android development.

In this app you will find:
* Google Places API
* (Kinda) Clean approach (interfaces everywhere!)
* Material resources: CardViews, TextInputLayout, FloatButton, NavigationDrawer)
* Android 6.0 Permissions

TODO:
* Add signup/signin and store someway your collection of restaurands
* Add Retrofit + RxJava
* Implement a better weighted randomness algorith
* Better structure of the overall thing
